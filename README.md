Quantifying the responses of forest disturbances to climate warming is critical to our understanding of carbon cycles and energy balances of the Earth system. The impact of warming on bark beetle outbreaks is complex as multiple drivers of these events may respond differently to warming. Using a novel model of bark beetle biology and host tree interactions we assessed how contemporary warming affected western pine beetle (Dendroctonus brevicomis) populations and mortality of its host, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), during an extreme drought in the Sierra Nevada, California, United States. When compared with field data, our model captured the western pine beetle flight timing and rates of ponderosa pine mortality observed during the drought. In assessing the influence of temperature on western pine beetles, we found that contemporary warming increased the development rate of the western pine beetle and decreased the larval mortality rate of western pine beetle larvae leading to increased population growth during periods of lowered tree defense. We attribute a 29.9% (95% CI: 29.4%-30.2%) increase in ponderosa pine mortality during directly to increases in western pine beetle voltinism (i.e., associated with increased development rates of western pine beetle) and, to a much lesser extent, reductions in overwintering mortality. These findings, along with other studies, suggest each degree (°C) increase in temperature may have increased the number of ponderosa pine killed by upwards of 35-40% °C -1 if the effects of compromised tree defenses (15-20%) and increased bark beetle (WPB) populations (20%) are additive. We posit that to accurately project future levels of tree mortality; models need to consider climate’s influence on both host tree stress and the bark beetle population dynamics. 

In this project we constructed and parameterized a model of bark beetle phenology and host defense to simulate western pine beetle mortality in ponderosa pine hosts. We parameterized and validated this model using beetle flight and FIA records of tree mortality. Then we tested two hypothesis first that contemporary warming led to increased tree host mortality during a 2012-2016 Sierra Nevada drought and insect outbreak, and second that this was driven primarily through increase in the annual number of bark beetle generations.
